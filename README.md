# Beam2D 

Beam2D is a 2D C++ game engine built on raylib 3.0 and OpenGL. It is meant to expand raylib 3.0 functionality past simple single level games using an entity component system, OOP and interface layers. Also will introduce common game engine features such as Game Objects, Scenes, Input Management, Audio Management and more.

Future plans include replacing raylib with GFLW and GLEW to manage OpenGL interface, for a more lightweight system that is focused on general development use/

Still in early development.
